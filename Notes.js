3.  File execute command: node anyFile.js

string+number = string
number+string = string
number+number = number

= assignment
== compare the value
=== compare the value and datatype

Practice
four.JS
* If in slice only digit is provided this will remove how many
In Case 2 value it will pick from given range



Slice(start,end)
>if first value is -ve than output is null
>if first positive and second -ve and remove from both direction
Substring(start,end)
> -ve value is ignored
Substr(start,length)
> if only one value and that is -ve it start from backward

---------------------------
Push => always add in the end of the Array
Pop => always take out form the end of Array
shift=> always take out from the begining of Array
unshift => always add at the begining of Array
